This is a Android drawing application created for a computer interaction design course, CMSC434, at the University of Maryland, College Park. Functionality of the app includes drawing with different sized paint brushes, changing colors, changing opacity, clearing the image, and setting the already drawn image to greyscale. 

User can adjust paintbrush size by clicking on the painbrush icon in the top toolbar. Size can be controlled with the seek bar where the maximum brush size is 30dp. Colors can be controlled on the bottom color panel where each individual color button can be clicked to switch the drawing color. Opacity is controled by clicking the icon with the varying shades of pink. The opacity can be changed from 0% to 100% with the seek bar. The picture can be deleted be clicking on the trashcan item and selected "OK" to clear it. Finally, a greyscale version of the image can be displayed by clicking on the shades of grey icon.

All final code was written and modified by me, but support for layout styles, and greyscale functionality was obtained from the following online posts:

My code was modified from the functions showed in both of these posts to include additional functionality or completely knew functionality aside from the suggested layout.
